# Simulated Calibration Images

## Folder Structure
Calibration images (.mat file) sorted by phantom sizes \
Filename: [DENSITY]rod[KV]

## Image Geometry
Single calibration rod with a diameter of 10mm

## Calcium Density(ies)
25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 750, 800 mgHA/cc

## Simulated Computed Tomography Parameter
Dual energy: 80 and 135 kV \
Exposure of calibration: (SD of calibration rod keeps around 7 at 135kV, can be further increased to reduce noise) \
  i.	Small-sized Phantom: 10 mR \
  ii.	Medium-sized Phantom: 25 mR \
  iii.	Large-sized Phantom: 54 mR
