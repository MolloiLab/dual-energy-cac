# Simulated Measurement Images

## Folder Structure
DICOM images of mass measurement phantom arranged by phantom sizes, densities and KV \
PHANTOMSIZE/KV/IMAGES \
[SIZE] are first set of images (good result), [SIZE1] are second set of images with more focus on lower density (sysmetic error)

## Image Geometry
QRM phantom - 3 sets of densities in one image w/ 3 different sizes of inserts

## Calcium Density(ies)
[SIZE] 
  1. 733, 411, 151 mg/cc 
  2. 669, 370, 90 mg/cc 
  3. 552, 222, 52 mg/cc \
\[SIZE1]
  1. 797, 101, 37 mg/cc 
  2. 403, 48, 32 mg/cc 
  3. 199, 41, 27 mg/cc
