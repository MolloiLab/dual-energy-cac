# Simulated Measurement Images

## Folder Structure
DICOM images of mass measurement phantom arranged by phantom sizes, densities and KV \
PHANTOMSIZE/KV/IMAGES \
[SIZE] are first set of images (good result), [SIZE1] are second set of images with more focus on lower density (sysmetic error)

## Image Geometry
QRM phantom - 3 sets of densities in one image w/ 3 different sizes of inserts

## Calcium Density(ies)
<div style="text-align: left">[SIZE]  <br/>
  1. 733, 411, 151 mg/cc <br/>
  2. 669, 370, 90 mg/cc <br/>
  3. 552, 222, 52 mg/cc <br/>
<div style="text-align: left">[SIZE1]  <br/>
  1. 797, 101, 37 mg/cc <br/>
  2. 403, 48, 32 mg/cc <br/>
  3. 199, 41, 27 mg/cc <br/>

## Simulated Computed Tomography Parameter
Exposure (same of integrated technique, increasing the exposure can help reduce the noise and possibly contribute to a better measurement result): <br/>
  i.	Small-sized Phantom: 0.9 mR <br/>
  ii.	Medium-sized Phantom: 2 mR <br/>
  iii.	Large-sized Phantom:5.4 mR <br/>
